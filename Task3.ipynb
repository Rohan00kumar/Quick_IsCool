    "## Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in computer science that focuses on optimization. Given a list of cities, the goal is to determine the shortest route that allows a salesman to visit each city once and return to the starting city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function: tsp_dynamic_programming(locations, distances)\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python function solves the TSP using dynamic programming. It takes two arguments:\n",
    "- `locations`: a list of cities\n",
    "- `distances`: a 2D list representing the distances between each pair of cities\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns the minimum total distance that the salesman needs to travel to visit all cities and return to the starting city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Programming Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The function uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant computations. It maintains a memoization table (`memo`), which is a dictionary that stores the shortest path for each subset of cities. The keys of this dictionary are tuples (`curr`, `mask`), where `curr` is the current city and `mask` is a binary number representing a subset of cities (1 means the city is in the subset, 0 means it is not).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function defines a nested function `dp(curr, mask)` which calculates the shortest path for the current city and the subset of cities represented by `mask`. This function is recursive: it tries all possible next cities to visit, calculates the distance for each possibility, and keeps track of the minimum distance. The base case for the recursion is when all cities have been visited (`mask == end`), in which case the function returns the distance from the current city to the starting city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provides an example usage of the function by defining a list of cities and a 2D list of distances. It then calls the `tsp_dynamic_programming` function with these inputs and prints the optimal distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Python code solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using dynamic programming. It uses a memoization table to store the shortest path for each subset of cities, avoiding redundant computations. The code defines a function `tsp_dynamic_programming` that takes a list of cities and a 2D list of distances as inputs and returns the minimum total distance for the TSP. An example usage of the function is provided, demonstrating how to calculate the optimal distance for a given set of cities and distances.\n"
