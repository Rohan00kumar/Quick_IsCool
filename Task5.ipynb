    "Write a Python function that performs molecular docking simulations to predict the binding affinity between a drug molecule and a target protein. The function should take as input the 3D structures of the drug molecule and the protein, and implement a scoring function to evaluate the binding affinity. The goal is to identify the most favorable binding pose of the drug molecule within the protein's binding site.\n",

The function should encode the molecular structures into qubits, apply quantum gates to simulate the binding process, and measure the energy of the system to estimate the binding affinity."
